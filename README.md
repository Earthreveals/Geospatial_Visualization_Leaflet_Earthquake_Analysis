## Installation
To set up this project locally, clone the repository and ensure you have all the required libraries installed.

## Libraries Required
The following JavaScript libraries are used in this project:

Leaflet - for interactive maps
D3.js - for data-driven manipulations
Include these libraries in your HTML file as shown in the Setup section.

## Data
The earthquake data is sourced from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) API, which provides GeoJSON formatted feeds.

## Analysis
The analysis involves fetching the real-time earthquake data from the USGS API and using Leaflet to plot the data points based on longitude and latitude. 
The size and color of the markers represent the magnitude and depth of the earthquakes, respectively.

## Results
The visualization displays earthquakes as circular markers on the map. A larger size indicates a higher magnitude, while a darker color indicates a greater depth. 
Pop-ups provide additional information about each earthquake, such as location, magnitude, and depth.

## Usage
Open the index.html file in a browser to view the map. Ensure you have an active internet connection to fetch the latest earthquake data.
